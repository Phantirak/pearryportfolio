## About me
Hello! My name is Phantira Khachichit, or you can call me Pearry. I'm from Bangkok, Thailand. I am currently continue my master degree in Public Policy Data Analytics at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Prior to CMU, I studied Accounting and was working as central banker at the Bank of Thailand. Even though I had been involving in financial industry, my passionate in data has led me to a new journey toward data analytics! I have learned, tried, failed and successed in many new things in the past few years and "Telling Stories with Data" is another journey that I'm looking forward to explore!

## What I hope to learn
In this era of big data, we can not deny that data is everywhere and waiting for us to explore and extract the meaningful insight from it. However, interestingly that even we use the most complex ML or AI model, the result can be meaningless without the good visualization. Thus, I personally think that learning how to digest those complexity and visualize them in a way that helps the audiences see and gain better understand of story behind data is very important. I hope that I can learn how to create the right visualization that can bring everyone to the same page, regardless of who they are and where they are from.
