## About me
Hello! My name is Phantira Khachichit, or you can call me Pearry. I'm from Bangkok, Thailand. I am currently continue my master degree in Public Policy Data Analytics at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Prior to CMU, I studied Accounting and started my career path as associated auditor at Price Waterhouse Coopers. As a team leader, my role was to design methodology for reviewing and auditing business processes based on companiesâ€™ risks as well as analyzed financial statements to investigate significant and unexpected financial events. I then shifted my career path to work as government agency at a Central Bank of Thailand. Here, I has a chance to be in "Supervisory Technology Division". I was part of the leading team in developing the innovative tools and applications to support supervisory functions and enhance efficiency in risk monitoring for financial supervisory processes. Besides this, my resposibility was to perform data analysis to support policy questions and to recommend financial stability measures using transactional data from all financial institutions in Thailand. And these trigger my passionate in data and has led me to a new journey here at CMU. I have learned, tried, failed and successed in many new things in the past few years and "Telling Stories with Data" is another journey that I'm looking forward to explore!

## What I hope to learn
In this era of big data, we can not deny that data is everywhere and waiting for us to explore and extract the meaningful insight from it. However, interestingly that even we use the most complex ML or AI model, the result can be meaningless without the good visualization. Thus, I personally think that learning how to digest those complexity and visualize them in a way that helps the audiences see and gain better understand of story behind data is very important. I hope that I can learn how to create the right visualization that can bring everyone to the same page, regardless of who they are and where they are from.
